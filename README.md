I’m a builder focused on AI-powered developer tools, macOS applications, and real-time data platforms. Currently deep in the world of agentic engineering—building tools that close the gap between "vibe-coding" and production-ready software.

### 🚀 Active Projects
- **[Galactic](https://github.com/idolaman/galactic)** – A command center to ship 10x faster with a parallel Claude Code fleet, featuring isolated Git Worktrees and zero-conflict networking.
- **[Agentboard](https://github.com/idolaman/Agentboard)** – A unified sidebar for VS Code and Cursor to monitor and control all your AI agents (Claude, GPT, etc.) in a single view.
- **[Idletime](https://github.com/idolaman/idletime)** – A Chrome extension to visualize and reclaim your digital focus by tracking and managing idle periods.

### 🛠️ What I'm Doing
